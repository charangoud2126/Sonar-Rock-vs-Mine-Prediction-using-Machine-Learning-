# 🚢 Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether an object detected by sonar signals is a Rock (R) or a Mine (M).

The model analyzes sonar frequency signals reflected from objects underwater and learns patterns to classify them accurately.

This is a classic binary classification problem widely used to understand ML model building, preprocessing, and evaluation.
